## Overview

This project is a simple login page implementation using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. User details, including name, email, and password, are securely stored in MongoDB. The application utilizes bcryptjs for password encryption and express-validator for input validation on the server side. The front-end is built with ReactJS, and Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing user information securely.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, used to handle server-side logic and routing.
- **ReactJS:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the front-end development.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **bcryptjs:** A library for hashing and salting passwords, enhancing security.
- **express-validator:** Middleware for input validation on the server side.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for designing a clean and responsive user interface.

## Features

1. **User Registration:** Allows users to register by providing a name, email, and password.
2. **Password Encryption:** Utilizes bcryptjs to securely hash and salt passwords before storing them in the database.
3. **Input Validation:** Uses express-validator to validate user input on the server side, enhancing security.
4. **React Hooks:** Leverages React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useNavigate, etc., for managing state and navigation within the front-end.
5. **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for easy and responsive styling, enhancing the user interface.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a-mythh/Login-Page-MERN.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash

    ```
3. **Install dependencies for both the server and client:**
    ```bash
    cd backend && npm install
    ```
    ```bash
    cd frontend && npm install
    ```
4. **Configure MongoDB.**
5. **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend && npm start
    ```
6. **Start the client:**
    ```bash
    cd client && npm start
    ```
7. **Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.**
